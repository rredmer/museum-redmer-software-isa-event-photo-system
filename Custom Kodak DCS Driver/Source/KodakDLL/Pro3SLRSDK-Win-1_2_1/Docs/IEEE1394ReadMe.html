<h3><a name=operating>Operating System Support</a></h3>
 The IEEE 1394 support libraries included with the application 
software you have installed have been certified on Windows 2000
and Windows XP Professional. We have not done anything purposefully 
to break Windows 98SE, Windows ME, or Windows NT 4.0 but no testing 
effort was applied to those operating systems. Windows 95 is not 
supported and there is no intent to support Windows 95 in a future 
release.

Other IEEE 1394 OHCI and PCMCIA CardBus adapters may provide adequate performance but 
our testing to date has been limited to the above mentioned adapters. If you choose to 
use an adapter other than the ones listed that you limit your selection to those that use 
the Texas Instruments IEEE 1394 chipset. Connectivity issues have been identified with 
adapters that use the NEC IEEE 1394 chipset.

<h3><a name=software>Software</a></h3>
Windows 98SE, ME, 2000, and XP operating systems come with drivers for IEEE 1394. An issue 
was found that significantly affected our performance with these supplied drivers on Windows 
98SE and 2000. The issue was reported to Microsoft and they have since made the necessary 
changes to improve our performance. It is necessary that you upgrade the drivers on your system 
to the versions Microsoft has made available. Click on the appropriate link below to obtain your 
upgrade.

<br>
<br>
Notes: 
<br>
There may be a fee with associated with the Windows 2000 upgrade<br>
This upgrade is not required for Windows 2000 Service Pack 2<br>
This upgrade is not required for Windows ME<br>
This upgrade is not required for Windows XP<br>
Follow the instructions documented on the sites for updating the drivers<br>
<br>
Windows NT 4.0 does not come with a driver for the Adaptec 8920 or 8940 IEEE 1394 adapters. 
The adapters themselves come with a driver called Hot Connect. It is required that you install 
Hot Connect version 2.0 or newer. If your adapter did not come with version 2.0 or newer you can 
download it from Adaptec. Click on the link below to get to the Adaptec website and search for 
Hot Connect.<br>

<h3><a name=installation>Installation</a></h3>
When you first plug in your new DCS 760, 760M, 720x cameras, Pro Back, or Pro Back Plus, the 
operating system will display the "New Hardware Found" dialog. To install the driver software 
for your new camera or back have the software CDROM you received with it in your CDROM drive 
and click on the appropriate link below to get instructions for installing a device driver. The 
folder where the drivers are located on the CDROM is "WDMDrivers\ProDriver". There is a folder 
for each operating system.<br>
<br>

<br>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/professional/help/"> For Windows 2000 and XP</a><br>
Scroll down the Window on the left side of the page and find "Control Panel". Under that is an 
icon named "Add Remove Hardware". Left click the + sign to expand the menu choices. Double click 
the "Installing Devices" option under the "Install or Uninstall Device" option. Once this page 
opens, select the option at the bottom titled "Install a device".<br>
<br>
If you have a legacy camera (DCS 315, 330, 520, 560, 620, 620x, 660, or 660M) and plan on 
simultaneously tethering it to your PC with your new camera or back, it is required that you 
upgrade the driver you received previously. To complete the upgrade, have the software CDROM 
you received with your new camera or back in your CDROM drive. Have the legacy camera you wish 
to upgrade the driver for attached. Click on the appropriate link below to get the instructions 
for updating a driver. The folder where the updated drivers are located on the CDROM is 
WDMDrivers\DCSDriver. There is a folder for each of the operating systems.<br>

icon named "Add Remove Hardware". Left click the + sign to expand the menu choices. Double click 
the "Installing Devices" option under the "Install or Uninstall Device" option. Once this page opens, 
select the option at the bottom titled "Plug and Play device driver support". At the bottom of that 
page select "Update or change a device driver".<br>

<h3><a name=limitations>Limitations</a></h3>
These new versions of the IEEE 1394 drivers do not support "Hot Pluggability". What does this mean? 
When the application is active, connecting new cameras or disconnecting currently attached cameras 
is not supported. It is highly recommended that you not attempt this, as it will potentially hang 
the system forcing a reboot. If you need to connect other cameras, or disconnect any that you have
connected, you should exit the application first. After you have completed your connection/disconnection 
action then you can reactivate the application. This will be corrected in a future release.<br>
<br>
At this time Direct Memory Access (DMA) is not supported on Windows 98SE, ME, 2000, and XP.  This means 
that the transfer time of images from the camera's or back's memory or PCMCIA card to a location on your 
hard drive is not optimized. This will be corrected in a future release. Typical speeds we are seeing 
is 3.5 to 4.0 MB/sec on a 500MHz Pentium II machine with 128MB of memory.<br>
